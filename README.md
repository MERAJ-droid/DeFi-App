# Decentralized Finance (DeFi) App

A Decentralized Finance (DeFi) application that enables users to lend, borrow, and exchange cryptocurrencies in a secure, transparent, and decentralized manner. The platform leverages Ethereum and the Internet Computer blockchains, using Solidity for Ethereum smart contracts and Motoko for deploying contracts on the Internet Computer, ensuring a hybrid approach that maximizes security and scalability.
## Features

- Lending & Borrowing: Securely lend or borrow cryptocurrencies directly on the blockchain.
- Crypto Exchange: Seamlessly swap between supported cryptocurrencies.

- Wallet Integration: Connect your digital wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the platform.

- Decentralized Storage: Utilize IPFS for secure and decentralized storage of user data.
- Gas Optimization: Efficiently optimized smart contracts to reduce transaction fees.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React.js

**Blockchain:** Ethereum, Solidity, Truffle, Motoko

**Backend:** Node.js

**Blockchain Interaction:** Web3.js

**Decentralized Storage:** IPFS


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/defi-app.git
  cd defi-app

```
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```
3. Compile and migrate the smart contracts:

```bash
  truffle compile
  truffle migrate --network <network-name>
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
  npm start
```


## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Connect your wallet (MetaMask) to the platform.
3. Choose to lend, borrow, or swap cryptocurrencies.
4. Confirm transactions on your wallet to interact with the blockchain.

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. They facilitate lending, borrowing, and swapping securely and transparently.
